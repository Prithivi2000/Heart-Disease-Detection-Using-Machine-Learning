What Does The Predcition Tell About The Heart Of the Individual?
ANS] num: diagnosis of heart disease (angiographic disease status)
-- Value 0: < 50% diameter narrowing
-- Value 1: > 50% diameter narrowing
(in any major vessel: attributes 59 through 68 are vessels)


Data Input Should Be Given In order Explained Below:
    1.(age)
    2.(sex)
    3.(cp)
    4.(trestbps)
    5.(chol)
    6.(fbs)
    7.(restecg)
    8.(thalach)
    9.(exang)
    10.(oldpeak)

INDEX:
1.age: age in years
2.sex: sex (1 = male; 0 = female)
3.cp: chest pain type
    -- Value 1: typical angina
    -- Value 2: atypical angina
    -- Value 3: non-anginal pain
    -- Value 4: asymptomatic
4.trestbps: resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
5.chol: serum cholestoral in mg/dl
6.fbs: (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)
7.restecg: resting electrocardiographic results
    -- Value 0: normal
    -- Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)
    -- Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria
8.thalach: maximum heart rate achieved
9.exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
10.oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
